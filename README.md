# Phrase-Encryptor
Was an old c++ assignment that I re-wrote in python.

Currently using a Ceaser Cipher to "encrypt" a phrase.
There is also a method for decrypting the sting if the key known, or else there is a brute force (ceaser-cipher) decryption method. 
Will add more features to the code in the future.
